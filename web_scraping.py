'''
Program which scrapes questions, answers and feedback from local html file

Currently (26/04/18), questions with drop downs as answers cannot have its answer
scraped, in addition to questions that have drag and drop features.

Therefore, numbering of questions, answers and feedback will not necessarily match

Another 'bug' is that this character (Ã‚) appears sometimes, and without
looking too indepth, it's just easier to not worry about them unless necessary

Thoughts for improvement:
first look at question type (e.g. multichoice, truefalse) , so that it can be stored and empty spaces can be
inserted if a question is not scrapable.
